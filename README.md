stands for Nextfight Elytra Race Helper.
It is a mod specifically made for the Minecraft Server Nextfight.net and therefore only works on Nextfight (The Race can be found in the Lobby of the Battleroyale GameMode). The Mod helps by counting the times between Rings locally. Therefore the times the mod counts and the server has may be different, but are mostly withing 100ms. After each race is completed the time is saved to a local Database, wich can be found under (McDirecory)/ElytraHelper/times.db, and the Sum Of best (You take the shortest Time for each Ring and add them together) is calculated. If you have a new Personal Sum of best it is shown in Chat.

If you want to view your times you can do so with the command /times. This brings up a gui where you can see the date of the time on the left, the individual ring time under the corresponing ring and the total on the right. At the bottom is a page counter and you can switch pages with the "previous" and "next" buttons. You can sort this list by tapping the icons next to the Names of the collumns and the list will update. The current SumOfBest can be viewed by tapping the SumOfBest button up top.
